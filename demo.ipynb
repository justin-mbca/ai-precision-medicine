    "This notebook presented a minimal, reproducible workflow for integrating synthetic NGS variant data and structured clinical data to predict therapy response using interpretable models. Key steps included data alignment, gene-level encoding, and model interpretation. All data were synthetic and results are illustrative only. Limitations include the use of mock data, small sample size, and simplified feature engineering. This workflow is intended to demonstrate feasibility and logic, not clinical validity or performance."
